This code implements a basic carousel with manual navigation buttons and automatic sliding.
It follows these best practices:

Modular design: The sliding logic is encapsulated in a separate showSlider function.
Event delegation: The code uses event listeners for button clicks, which is more efficient than attaching an event listener to each element.
Timeout management: It properly clears existing timeouts to prevent overlapping animations.
Reusable code: The sliding logic works for both next and previous directions.
Separation of concerns: DOM selection and event handling are separated from the core functionality.

The carousel uses CSS classes for animation, making it easy to customize the appearance without changing the JavaScript code. It also handles wrapping around, providing a smooth user experience.
